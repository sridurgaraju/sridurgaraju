## **👋 Hey there! I’m Sri Durga Raju 🌟**

I’m a **Computer & Systems Engineering** enthusiast with a passion for **hardware design**, **verification**, and bringing ideas to life through **FPGA** and **ASIC**. Currently diving into **UVM**, **SystemVerilog**, and **cutting-edge memory systems**!

## 👀 What I'm Into:
- Building robust **verification environments** with **UVM** and **SystemVerilog** 🔧
- Experimenting with **FPGA boards** and prototyping systems 🛠️
- Designing next-gen **analog/digital circuits** 💡
- Diving deep into **computer architecture** and understanding how processors tick 🧠

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- Perfecting my **UVM** testbenches with **SystemVerilog** (because, why not make verification fun?) 🖥️
- Digging into the world of **ReRAM technology** and how it's revolutionizing **memory systems** 💾
- Exploring **secure hardware architectures** and how we can protect the next generation of devices 🔐

## 💞️ Open to Collaborating On:
- **UVM** testbenches for complex protocols (SPI, I2C, UART) 🧪
- **FPGA-based verification** and **SoC design** 🧩
- **Quantum hardware research** or any **cool** project that blends **hardware** and **AI** 🤖
